## Favourite projects

- [FlaskStore](https://github.com/andrewmaci/python-projects/tree/main/FlaskStore) - RESTful store API created with Flask, Flask-smorest, SQLAlchemy and JWT tokens. The site allows for creation of stores, items and tags.

- [WebScraping](https://github.com/andrewmaci/python-projects/tree/main/WebScraping) - Python scrapers implemented mainly with **aiohttp**, **selenium**, **beautifulsoup**.

- [PythonMorse](https://github.com/andrewmaci/python-projects/tree/main/PythonMorse) - Side project created to test ChatGPT3.5 if it is capable of cummunicating with morse code. Instead of using pre-existing converters I decided to create my own. **Conclusions** - During testing ChatGPT3.5 was mostly capable of comprehending sent messages but struggled with responses, spewing gibberish and sometimes locking itself in a loop sending the same message. Simillar behaviour could be observed with Bard.
